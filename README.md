# Dockerizing a Python Script: Step-by-Step Guide.

Dockerizing a Python script allows you to create a consistent and isolated environment for your code, regardless of where it's run. In this guide, we will cover the basics of Dockerizing a Python script, from creating a simple Python script that processes data from a CSV file using the pandas library to building and running it within a Docker container.

Containers are essential in modern software development, especially in DevOps, where we aim to streamline deployment and make applications portable and scalable. Docker is the go-to tool for containerization. 

Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of Docker and Python.
- Docker installed on your machine (Install Docker).
- A sample Python script to work with.

#

**1. Create your working environment.**

`mkdir docker-project-2`

`cd docker-project-2`

**2. Setting Up a Simple Python Script.**

`nano process_data.py`
